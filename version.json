  "Notes": "This update fixes the issue where the page was not automatically closed after navigating to shortcuts. This required me to implement the forward/back navigation using a library instead of the browser itself. If you have troubles with the swipe gestures, please report it to me. I've also added keyboard shortcuts for navigation which you can find in the help menu.",
