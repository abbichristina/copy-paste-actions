# Report a bug/request a feature

Have you discovered a bug or thought about a new feature I could implement? Please report it to me so I can fix or implement it! But before you do, please have a look through the GitHub issues (link further down) if somebody else has already found the same bug.

Please write to me in English or German. I can't gurantee that I answer on any message in any other language.
